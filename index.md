## Pump and Dump, Wash Trades, Spoofing - Illegal & Criminal Crypto Price Manipulations

Crypto eco-system includes thousands of chat rooms where cryptocrazies scheme daily to manipulate crypto prices: pump and dump; wash trades; spoofing; etc. All practices that are officially ILLEGAL/CRIMINAL. Mother of all scams.  So why is SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) asleep at the wheel and does nothing?

Finally the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is starting to warn investors about Initial Coin Scams...
that web site was created by the SEC to show investors the obvious signs of such too-good-to-be-true-token-scams.

Another whalepool recording scheming manipulation of crypto-currencies. A trader admitted personally to me: "it is not "illegal" to front run and pump and dump as these are not "securities" and thus not subject to securities laws". What a sleazy chutzpah!

## Crypto Fudge - Shut Up! Crypto Zealot Cultists Accept No Arguments or Critiques     


Stop the FUDGE! Crypto-zealots engage in daily FUDGE: vaporware, manipulation, obfuscation, bullshit

FUDGE: present or deal with (something) in a vague, noncommittal, or inadequate way, especially so as to conceal the truth or mislead. Synonyms: evade, avoid, dodge, skirt,  duck
-- [6 May 2018](https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/993159635237416965)


Cryptozealots try to muzzle anyone critically dissecting the flaws of crypto-currencies by accusing him of spreading FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) rather than rebut the critique. But cryptos engage instead in constant daily FUDGE.
So anytime they call you FUD call them back FUDGE.

## Bitcoin - Rich Getting Richer

There are about 1 million holders of Bitcoin; 47 individuals hold about 30%, another 900 hold a further 20%, the next 10 000 about 25% and another million about 20%, with 5% being lost. So 0.1% represent about half the holdings of Bitcoin and 1% close to 80%
-- [11 May 2018](https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/995004255114326017)

The distribution of Bitcoin holdings looks much like the distribution of wealth in North Korea
and makes the China's and even the United States' wealth distribution look like that of a workers' paradise
Bitcoin. Gini Coefficient: 0.88

How Bitcoin is like North Korea

Bill Gates says he would bet against bitcoin if he could as it is a "greater fool" investment.

"As an asset class, you're not producing anything and so you shouldn't expect it to go up. It's kind of a pure 'greater fool theory' type of investment".

## Are We Centralized Yet? Cryptoland a Plutocracy? 

> Facts Please writes:
>
> The big lie of crypto is that things are decentralized.

It is indeed a big lie.
Crypto is increasingly massively centralized and plutocratic: miners oligopoly, exchanges concentration, ownership of crypto-assets more unequal than North Korea, developers beings designers, cops, prosecutors and judges and pretending that code is law.
-- [17 May 2018](https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/997079442701869057)


Indeed Cryptoland is a whale-dominated plutocracy.
Worse, like Trump, it is a plutocracy disguised in populist clothes (pretending to care about the poor and dispossed).
So it is pluto-populism run by a bunch of pluto-populists enriching themselves by scamming clueless investors.
-- [16 May 2018](https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/996838121965842433)





## Ethereum - The Decentralized Future of Apps?

"All of the top decentralized apps are still very much about speculation of value. Decentralized exchanges, casino games, pyramid schemes... are all around speculation". No useful decentralized app and the industry doesn't even
clean up criminal pyramid schemes. Shame on Ethereum!
-- [6 May 2018](https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/993127057151246336)


50% of decentralized apps are decentralized exchanges (DEXs)
that have no liquidity and transact useless tokens,
25% are silly games such as cryptokitties and 20% are ponzi pyramid schemes. So get the real facts on the junky "use cases" of Ethereum and stop living in your bubble. Can't bullshit me as I know my facts.

And development is centralized too. Vitalik Buterin is "dictator for life" .
And code ISN'T law as The Distributed Autonomous Organisation (DAO) showed:
developers/dictators are police, prosecutors and judges at the same time. So they create their totally arbitrary law based on their whims

## Centralized Mining - All Your Free Lottery Money are Belong to Us

The top bitcoin (BTC) miner controls 25% of mining capacity.
Top 3 miners control 55%. Top 6 control 74%. So bitcoin (BTC) is NOT decentralized. It is HIGHLY centralized.

Proof of work leads to miners' concentration whether it is ZCash or Bitcoin or Ethereum.
The move of some cryptocurrencies to proof of stake will make that concentration risk even worse.
One miner is already controlling 40% of Ethereum mining.
And that oligopoly power will get worse with proof of stake.

Apart from being a dumb game CryptoKitties has low and falling transactions.
Compared to any good video game it has transaction volume that is 0.001% than any game.

can cite for a decentralized app. With success like this...

## Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) - The Mother of All Scams


Call Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) for their true name: Initial Coin Scams (ICSs).
81% of them are scams to begin with. Another 11% are dead or failed.
So barely 8% trade on an exchange and most of those are non-compliant securities skirting all securities laws
-- [11 May 2018](https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/994882522885623809)


ICOs are indeed the mother of all scams.  81% of them are scams to begin with. Another 11% are failed or gone dead. Even most of the 8% that make it to an exchange often cause large market losses to investors as they are weak, flimsy, vaporware ventures

## Tokens, Tokens, Tokens - Run Your Own Cartel

Read my [Project Syndicate Op-Ed](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ico-cryptocurrency-scams-by-nouriel-roubini-2018-05) on why tokens are non-compliant scams

So called crypto-"currencies" aren't a means of payment (way too costly with three transaction costs), aren't a unit of account and aren't a stable or safe or secure store of value. Thus, they are NOT currencies. They are the mother of all rip-offs!

Actually in a crypto world economic/financial disasters will be more virulent/frequent than
today as, before fiat money and central banks, bubbles were bigger and more disastrous.
Central banks were created to avoid runs via lender of last resort support.

Banks don't need a bailout to make me whole if my account is hacked. They have their internal funds for all fraud cases. And my deposit insurance, in case of bank insolvency, is paid for by fees paid by banks. And
