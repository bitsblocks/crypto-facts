## Pump and Dump, Wash Trades, Spoofing - Illegal & Criminal Crypto Price Manipulations

Crypto eco-system includes thousands of chat rooms where cryptocrazies scheme daily to manipulate crypto prices: pump and dump; wash trades; spoofing; etc. All practices that are officially ILLEGAL/CRIMINAL. Mother of all scams.  So why is SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) asleep at the wheel and does nothing?

that web site was created by the SEC to show investors the obvious signs of such too-good-to-be-true-token-scams.

Another whalepool recording scheming manipulation of crypto-currencies. A trader admitted personally to me: "it is not "illegal" to front run and pump and dump as these are not "securities" and thus not subject to securities laws". What a sleazy chutzpah!

As this paper shows wash trading, spoofing, front-running, price manipulating are standard operating practices in crypto-land and in crypto-exchanges. When will regulators wake up and start cracking down on these criminal activities?

## Crypto Fudge - Shut Up! Crypto Zealot Cultists Accept No Arguments or Critiques     


Stop the FUDGE! Crypto-zealots engage in daily FUDGE: vaporware, manipulation, obfuscation, bullshit

FUDGE: present or deal with (something) in a vague, noncommittal, or inadequate way, especially so as to conceal the truth or mislead. Synonyms: evade, avoid, dodge, skirt,  duck
-- [6 May 2018](https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/993159635237416965)


Cryptozealots try to muzzle anyone critically dissecting the flaws of crypto-currencies by accusing him of spreading FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) rather than rebut the critique. But cryptos engage instead in constant daily FUDGE.
So anytime they call you FUD call them back FUDGE.

## Bitcoin - Rich Getting Richer

There are about 1 million holders of Bitcoin; 47 individuals hold about 30%, another 900 hold a further 20%, the next 10 000 about 25% and another million about 20%, with 5% being lost. So 0.1% represent about half the holdings of Bitcoin and 1% close to 80%
-- [11 May 2018](https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/995004255114326017)

The distribution of Bitcoin holdings looks much like the distribution of wealth in North Korea
and makes the China's and even the United States' wealth distribution look like that of a workers' paradise
Bitcoin. Gini Coefficient: 0.88

## Are We Centralized Yet? Cryptoland a Plutocracy? 

> Facts Please writes:
>
> The big lie of crypto is that things are decentralized.

It is indeed a big lie.
Crypto is increasingly massively centralized and plutocratic: miners oligopoly, exchanges concentration, ownership of crypto-assets more unequal than North Korea, developers beings designers, cops, prosecutors and judges and pretending that code is law.
-- [17 May 2018](https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/997079442701869057)


Indeed Cryptoland is a whale-dominated plutocracy.
Worse, like Trump, it is a plutocracy disguised in populist clothes (pretending to care about the poor and dispossed).
So it is pluto-populism run by a bunch of pluto-populists enriching themselves by scamming clueless investors.

## Ethereum - The Decentralized Future of Apps?

"All of the top decentralized apps are still very much about speculation of value. Decentralized exchanges, casino games, pyramid schemes... are all around speculation". No useful decentralized app and the industry doesn't even

50% of decentralized apps are decentralized exchanges (DEXs)

And development is centralized too. Vitalik Buterin is "dictator for life" .
And code ISN'T law as The Distributed Autonomous Organisation (DAO) showed:
developers/dictators are police, prosecutors and judges at the same time. So they create their totally arbitrary law based on their whims

## Centralized Mining - All Your Free Lottery Money are Belong to Us

Proof of work leads to miners' concentration whether it is ZCash or Bitcoin or Ethereum.
The move of some cryptocurrencies to proof of stake will make that concentration risk even worse.
One miner is already controlling 40% of Ethereum mining.
And that oligopoly power will get worse with proof of stake.

## Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) - The Mother of All Scams


Call Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) for their true name: Initial Coin Scams (ICSs).
81% of them are scams to begin with. Another 11% are dead or failed.
So barely 8% trade on an exchange and most of those are non-compliant securities skirting all securities laws

ICOs are indeed the mother of all scams.  81% of them are scams to begin with. Another 11% are failed or gone dead. Even most of the 8% that make it to an exchange often cause large market losses to investors as they are weak, flimsy, vaporware ventures

So called crypto-"currencies" aren't a means of payment (way too costly with three transaction costs), aren't a unit of account and aren't a stable or safe or secure store of value. Thus, they are NOT currencies. They are the mother of all rip-offs!

Actually in a crypto world economic/financial disasters will be more virulent/frequent than
today as, before fiat money and central banks, bubbles were bigger and more disastrous.

Most of your arguments ASSUME that a crypto financial system will be safer, more reliable, efficient, scalable,  less costly, freer than current financial systems that have evolved over thousands of years.
Those are ALL theoretical assumptions with NO empirical basis. Talk is cheap.

I accept the correction. So the Flintstones had a more developed monetary system with a real money than the stone age barter system recommended by the crypto-supporters of a world of tokenization. So the Flintstones are financially more advanced and sophisticated than the cryptos!

Indeed the current financial system is super-sophisticated and safe for bank customers while crypto-systems are like going back to Stone Age of Barter (tokenization of all goods) and the security of Middle Age coin wallets. Indeed the retrograde Crypto-Barbarians are at the gate

ATMs have strict limits to how much cash you can take out per day: a few hundreds dollars. Instead someone hacks your private key and ALL of your crypto-wealth is gone for good. And unlike bank accounts there is no trusted bank making you whole if someone hacked your account

Banks don't need a bailout to make me whole if my account is hacked. They have their internal funds for all fraud cases. And my deposit insurance, in case of bank insolvency, is paid for by fees paid by banks. And
bubbles/financial crises were more severe before fiat money and central banks.

## Drug Trafficking, Embezzlement, Money Laundering - Business As Usual

Regulators will soon crack down on use of cryptocurrencies in illegal and criminal activities.
AML (Anti Money Laundering)/KYC (Know Your Customer) and securities laws will be enforced. As US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin recently said: We can't allow cryptocurrencies to become the next Swiss bank account.
